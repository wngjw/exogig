# exogig

A lightweight, mobile friendly crowd interaction website.

Join events and request songs from live performers.

## Introduction

Exogig is a way for performing bands and artists to interact with an audience.

The main idea behind exogig is to provide all of the functionality of a native app without any of the clutter associated with installing one.

## Getting Started

Any user can enter a code to a live gig to view the set list, request songs, and participate in chat.

## Creating a Band

Register using our Google sign-in to create a band. Bands can create and start gigs.

## Starting a Gig

Band members can add songs and sets to a gig. When ready, a gig will go live and produce a gig code, which audience members can use to connect to the gig.
